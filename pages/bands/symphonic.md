Students selected for the Symphonic Band will need to demonstrate a high degree of proficiency on a selected instrument, be able to perform concert scales from memory, demonstrate competent mastery of range, tone, and sight reading, and perform a prepared solo.

The Symphonic Band members will rehearse a variety of musical styles and play music comparable to selections on the state high school lists of  required pieces.

Symphonic Band will be divided into two groups creating the Basketball Pep Bands, and each band will perform at half of the games. Students will need to complete additional requirements for honors credit.
